# Pipeline

This folder should contain all code and resources required for the pipeline.

## T3 Recommendations

### 1
- **Food truck 4 should be scrapped.**
It makes the least money by far and costs the same to run

### 2
- **Food truck 3 should begin selling more high value products**
This truck has a large amount of transactions but a low average transaction total, if there were more items at a higher price point this may increase profit.

### 3
- **Food truck 2 should include more low cost items.**
